foods.append('cheese')
print(foods)

# ? Use the list method "pop" to remove the first item of the array

foods.pop(0)
print(foods)

# ? Define a variable "joined". Assign its value to the foods list to a string of all the array items separated by  ','. Use the list method "join"

joined = ','.join(foods)
print(joined)
