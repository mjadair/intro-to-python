// ? Define an array called "foods", add a few strings of different food items, and log the array to the console

const foods = ['eggs', 'bacon', 'ham']

console.log(foods)

// ? Using the array method "push", add another food item to the end of the array, and log it again.

foods.push('cheese')
console.log(foods)

// ? Use the array method "slice" to remove the first item of the array

foods.splice(0, 1)
console.log(foods)

// ? Define a const "joined". Assign its value to the foods array to a string of all the array items joined together. Use the array method "join"

const joined = foods.join('')
console.log(joined)
