# ? Uncomment the followng array

# const fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'strawberry', 'kiwi', 'passion fruit', 'mango']


# ? Define a const "smallFruits" and assign it value of the fruits array, filtered to only contain fruits with 4 charaters or less
# ? Log the "smallFruits" array and expect to see -> ['pear', 'kiwi']



# ? Define a const "bigFruits" and assign it the value of the fruits array, filtered to only contain fruits with more than 6 characters ? Log the "bigFruits" array and expect to see -> ['stawberry', 'passion fruit']



# ? Define a const "mediumFruits" and assign it the value of the fruits array, filtered to only contain fruits with more than 4 characters but less than or equal to 6 characters
# ? Log the "mediumFruits" array and expect to see -> ['apple', 'mango']


# ? Log the original "fruits" array. What has happened to it?
