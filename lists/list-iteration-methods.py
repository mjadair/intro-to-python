# *  ----- FILTERING LISTS ------ *
# ! Navigate to the directory and type `python list-iteration-methods.py` to run the file

# * 🦉 Practice


# ! ⚠️Remember to comment out your practice code before attempting below, "cmd" + "/"


# ? Uncomment the followng list

# fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'strawberry', 'kiwi', 'passion fruit', 'mango']


# ? Define a variable "smallFruits" and assign it value of the fruits list, filtered to only contain fruits with 4 charaters or less
# ? Print the "smallFruits" list and expect to see -> ['pear', 'kiwi']



# ? Define a variable called "bigFruits" and assign it the value of the fruits list, filtered to only contain fruits with more than 6 characters
# ? Log the "bigFruits" list and expect to see -> ['stawberry', 'passion fruit']



# ? Define a const "mediumFruits" and assign it value of the fruits list, filtered to only contain fruits with more than 4 characters but less than or equal to 6 characters
# ? Log the "mediumFruits" list and expect to see -> ['apple', 'mango']


# ? Print the original "fruits" list. What has happened to it?



# *  ----- MAPPING listS ------ *
# ! Remember to type `python list-iteration-methods.py` in terminal to run the file

# * 🦉 Practice

# ! ⚠️Remember to comment out your practice code before attempting below, "cmd" + "/"

# ? Uncomment the followng list

# cities = ['London', 'New York', 'Paris', 'Tokyo', 'Los Angeles']

# ? Define a variable "cityLengths" and assign it the value of the cities list, mapped into an list indicating the length of each city string
# ? Log the "cityLengths" list and expect to see -> [6, 8, 5, 5, 11]





# ? Define a variable "cityShouts" and and assign it the value of the cities list, mapped into an list where all the strings have been transformed to uppercase with a '!' on the end
# ? Print the "cityShouts" list and expect to see ->  'LONDON!', 'NEW YORK!', 'PARIS!', 'TOKYO!', 'LOS ANGELES!' ]

# const cityShouts = cities.map(city => {
#   return city.toUpperCase() + '!'
# })




# ? Log the original "cities list. What has happened to it?
