// * 🦉 Practice









// ! ⚠️Remember to comment out your practice code before attempting below, "cmd" + "/"

// ? Declare two "consts", "numOne" and "numTwo", set their values to strings of number characters '10' and '5'




// ? Declare a new variable with "let" called result, use the "+" operator to assign it a value and log it so it produces "105"



// ? What is the type of result currently? Log it using the built in "typeof()" function




// ? Now re assign result to add the number 45 and log it. --> 150
// ? Log result in typeof again, what will it be now?
