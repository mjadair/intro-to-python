// ? Define a "const" with the label "num" and assign the value 10 



// ? Define a variable "result" using the "let" keyword, assign its value to our "num" + 50, and log it --> 60



// ? reassign "result", to be the value of itself divided by 2, log it out --> 30



// ? reassign "result" again, to be the value of itself minus 9 --> 21



// ? reassign "result" again, to be value of itself divided by 7 --> 3
